### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Sharmin Sultana

![Web developer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49096161?v=4)

I am a dedicated front-end developer with a strong passion for web development, driven by a deep curiosity to understand the inner workings of the web and a commitment to creating seamless user experiences. I hold both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Barishal, Barishal, Bangladesh.

Throughout my academic journey, I gained proficiency in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Android, and C#. I have also worked extensively with a range of web technologies, including Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, Angular, React.js, and Flutter. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with projects involving the .NET Framework, PHP, Java, React.js, and Next.js.

My journey into front-end development began by building websites for friends and local businesses, where I quickly recognized the value of well-designed user interfaces. This realization fueled my drive to further explore front-end technologies, leading me to master React.js and familiarize myself with tools such as Git and Webpack.

I am eager to learn and adapt quickly to new challenges. I am looking forward to joining a team where I can continue to develop my skills, collaborate with experienced developers, and contribute to projects that make a difference.

Iâ€™m excited about the opportunity to work on innovative projects, and Iâ€™m particularly interested in roles that allow me to grow in areas like performance optimization and user experience design.
